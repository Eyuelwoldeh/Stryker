Car and Missile Game
This project is a simple 2D game built in Python, where the player controls a missile launcher to intercept moving cars. It provides an interactive environment to practice object-oriented programming, randomization, and graphical displays.

Project Overview
Goal: The objective of the game is to eliminate all cars on the screen by launching missiles from the player's position. The cars move across the screen and respawn upon reaching the edge.
Features:
Cars with random starting positions and colors.
Missile launch with flame effects and collision detection.
Win and loss conditions based on game state.
Features
Car Objects: These move across the screen horizontally. Cars reset to the start when reaching the edge.
Missile Objects: When launched, these missiles move upward, leaving a flame trail.
Game Events:
Game Over (win) occurs when all cars are destroyed.
Loss occurs if the player crosses a certain screen boundary.
Getting Started
Install Requirements: You’ll need Python 3.x to run the game.
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-missile-game.git
Run the Game:
bash
Copy code
python car_missile_game.py
How to Play
Controls: Use the mouse to control the missile launcher position.
Launch Missiles: Press the mouse to launch missiles towards the cars.
Objective: Destroy all cars before running out of bounds.
Code Structure
Car Class: Creates car objects with properties like position, color, and movement logic.
Missile Class: Handles the missile’s properties and visual effects.
draw() Function: Renders game elements and checks for collisions.
game_over_message() and game_lost_message() Functions: Display win/loss messages based on conditions.
Future Enhancements
Level System: Implement levels with increasing difficulty.
Power-ups: Add power-ups or bonuses.
Multiplayer Mode: Add support for multiple players.
